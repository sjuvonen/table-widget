table-widget
============

Table widget for rendering lists of items into HTML tables. The table widget is a standalone class that has no external dependencies. As an extra this project can be also used as a Zend Framework 2 module.

Instructions for ZF2 integration:

1. Install this module (SamuTable)
2. Enable it in your application.config.php

Then in your view template you can access the view helper by simply calling $this->samuTable().

For examples about the general use, see [`demos` directory](https://github.com/sjuvonen/table-widget/tree/master/demos). Additional examples for using advanced ZF2 features, see [`docs` directory](https://github.com/sjuvonen/table-widget/tree/master/docs).
